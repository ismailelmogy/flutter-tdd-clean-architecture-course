## What's Included

- :star: **State Management** using the BLoC pattern
- :star: **Test-Driven Development** with unit tests for domain and data layers using `mocktail`
- :star: **Dependency Injection** using `get_it`
- :star: **Functional Programming** with `dartz` package
- :star: **Equality Checks** in classes using `equatable`
- :star: **REST API** integration with `http`
- :star: **Exception Handling** using custom Failure classes
- :star: **Persistent Data** using shared preferences
- :star: **Null Safety** support for safer, more reliable code

## Project Architecture

This project follows the principles of **Clean Architecture**. The code is split into the following layers:

- **Domain Layer**: Contains core business logic and use cases.
- **Data Layer**: Handles data from APIs, local databases, or any external sources.
- **Presentation Layer**: Manages the user interface (UI) using BLoC for state management.

By using this structure, it's easier to test, modify, and extend the application, especially in large-scale projects.

## Key Features

### 1. **Bloc State Management**
Bloc (Business Logic Component) is used for managing states across the app. This makes the app's business logic independent of the UI.

### 2. **Dependency Injection**
The `get_it` package is used for easy dependency injection, making it simple to switch implementations or mock objects for testing.

### 3. **Functional Programming with Dartz**
The `dartz` package enables functional programming patterns, such as using `Either` for handling failures and successes, ensuring clean and maintainable code.

### 4. **API Integration**
The app uses the `http` package for fetching data from a REST API. It retrieves [describe the data, e.g., trivia, user information].

### 5. **Error Handling**
Custom `Failure` classes handle exceptions gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience when errors occur.

### 6. **Null Safety**
This project is built with Dart's **Null Safety** features enabled, ensuring fewer runtime errors and safer code by handling null values properly.

## Testing

This project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** practices. Unit tests are provided for the domain, data, and presentation layers. To run the tests, use:

```bash
flutter test
```

We use the `mocktail` package for mocking dependencies in the tests. This ensures clean and isolated testing of components by mocking external dependencies such as services and repositories.
